Q1. You have a data frame 'd', which contains the column 'age'. Since this column is character, you would like to convert it to numeric. Please write down a command to do this
```{r}
load('d')
as.numeric(,'age')

```

Q2. Please write down a command to load a csv file, called 'myteam.txt' into a data frame object, called 'd'
```{r}
read.csv('myteam.txt')
d<- as.data.frame('myteam.txt')
```

Q3. Please write down a command to find the max value in the column 'age' in the data frame 'd'.
```{r}
max(d$age)
```
